In order to build st you need,
(Ubuntu)
```
sudo apt install make gcc build-essential libx11-dev libxft-dev fonts-fantasque-sans
```

## Installation
Edit `config.mk` to match your local setup (st is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

You will find all the configurations in `config.def.h` .

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install st (if
necessary as root):
```
make clean install
## or
sudo make clean install
```

## Running st
Installed using `make clean install`?
Go to the application menu and search for `st` or run `st` in your command runner.

If you did not install st with make clean install, you must compile
the st terminfo entry with the following command:

```
tic -sx st.info
```

See the man page for additional details.
